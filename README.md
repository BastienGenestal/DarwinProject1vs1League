# Darwin Project Duel League

- A Discord bot so players can challenge themselves to duel and enter scores.
  This bot interacts with the Database to update elos/vitory/defeats/win streaks...
- A ReactJS Website to display the leaderboard
- A Back End intercating with a mySQL DB

Discord is off for now since the game is dead.
